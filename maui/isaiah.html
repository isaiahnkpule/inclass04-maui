    <h5>Brief Bio</h5>
    <p>
    I am from Wai’anae, Hawai’i a local paradise but predominantly a low-income community. While a wonderful place to live and be from, there are many challenges, which our youth face on a daily basis. Wai’anae is one of the most socioeconomically and ethnically marginalized regions within the state. Roughly thirty percent of the population is considered to be living below the poverty level. 
    </p>

    <h5>Work expeirence</h5>
    <p>
    If I remember correctly, I have held roughly 12-15 different job titles. I’ve been working for money since the age of 14 and never stopped since. Prior to college, I have worked at six different companies; most of them required hard labor primarily done after school hours. So when it comes to actual work labor I am not afraid to take on the task. Moreover, I have never been fired from a position it was either I received a better offer or moved to a different location. I am currently employed at the University of Rochester Advancements department, handling majorly video production content. 
    </p>

    <h5>Summer Time</h5>
    <p>
    Eventful summer breaks, but I think the highlight of all my summers would be sailing with the Polynesian Voyaging Society. Even though my involvement/investment with the organization could fall into employment hours, I decide it was more of a hobby than anything else. I would go on voyages ranging from an entire day to three weeks out in the deep blue sea. I would also volunteer 2-3 days (8-12 hours) out of the week to do dry dock, lessons, conferences, or simple event planning.
