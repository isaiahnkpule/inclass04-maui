    <h5>Brief Bio</h5>

    <p>
    My name is Jovan Gianni Lee and am from Bronx, New York and went to St Raymond High School for Boys an all male Catholic School also located in the Bronx. Catholic School seemed to prepare me a little better compared another or pviate shcool by helping provide a structure and discipline. I did not initially mean to go to Rochester, I applied to many universities including SUNYs and CUNYs but only chose Rochester because they were one of the few Universiites in the NorthEast that offered a Naval Program for ROTC (NROTC). I attempted to apply for the ROTC scholarship but because I was only 17 at the time I was unable to apply.

    <h5>Work expeirence</h5>
    <p>
    My time there consisted on working on taking company software and creating a working mobile version so that Employees can read,sign, and update certain documents from their own phones instead of their computers if they'd like. I used When I say used I mean attempted. We had one week of personal training time to learn how to use a MEAN STACK. To explain the MEAN stack consists of Ionic, TypeScript, AngularJS and MongoDB. My second real job was when I decided to take a year off to help pay for school and find more motivation to learn. I enlisted in the Air national guard during the sophomore of my junior year and was given a date to go to basic training, technical school, and on-the-job training.

    <h5>Quote</h5>
    <p>
    "Now the commencement speakers will typically also wish you good luck and extend good wishes to you. I will not do that, and I will tell you why. From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated unfairly, so that you will come to know the value of justice. I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you do not take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you will be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they are going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes."
