    <h5>Brief Bio</h5>
    <p>
    Where you can see the colors changing through the sky as the sunset. Or take a 45 min hike up the mountain reign and you’ll find natural made ponds and streams. Here’s a quote that resonates in my head whenever I think of home: “You can take a boy from the island, but not the island from the boy. ‘Cause the island stays in your heart and I’ll never forget where I’m from.”

    <h5>Work expeirence</h5>
    <p>
    Before this position, I was working at the University of Rochester’s Event and Classroom Management department, in which I primarily dealt with technology. Nothing complicated; mostly projectors, troubleshooting laptops, dongles, setting up PA systems, and classrooms management. During the past four years of college I have worked seven different jobs, one summer I held three different positions. It was crazy to handle, but somehow I managed in the summer of 2016. If I recall correctly my schedule looked something like this:

    <h5>Summer</h5>
    <p>
    An ocean, which was so still it looked glossy rather than the water itself, until being touched. A simple ripple would spread for yards until fading away having the stage of the ocean all to itself. The day was full of relaxation, storytelling, and kanikapila (an impromptu Hawaiian jam session). Later that day as the sun was setting a whale decided to come around our idle drift in the ocean. Since the water was as still as it was, we could spot the incoming whale from a while away. As it stayed with us through the rest of the evening as we head into the night, we started to notice not only the light on the night sky but also the ocean. As the whale caused movements in the ocean, bioluminescent planktons lit up the ocean all within a 30-yard diameter from us. It was simply magical. A vast amount of stars lit up the night sky, making it nearly impossible to depict constellation. The cluttered sky gleamed with lights of various sizes and colors. The Milky Way galaxy itself made an appearance that night. It all came to an end the following day as the wind began to pick up mid-afternoon.
